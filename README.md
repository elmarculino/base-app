# Base Node/Express App w/ Babel

This is my base Node app to test and run any node module ASAP. Just clone, install new modules, add your test code and run.

### Getting Started

Install node dependencies.

```shell
$ npm install
```

Run the app.

```shell
$ npm start
```

Test the app.

```shell
$ npm test
```

Build & Serve the app.

```shell
$ npm run build
$ npm run serve
```

That's all folks!
